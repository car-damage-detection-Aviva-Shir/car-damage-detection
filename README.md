# Car Damage Detection

This project implements car damage detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and  VGG16 architecture. It provides a frontend interface built with Django and Atom framework, allowing users to upload an image of a damaged car and receive the detection report from the trained model.


## Features

- Utilizes the VGG16 architecture for car damage detection.
- Provides a user-friendly frontend interface built with Django and Atom framework.
- Allows users to upload car images and receive the detection report.
- Returns the detection report, indicating whether there is damage, and if so, the location of the damage (front, sides,rear) and its severity(minor, moderate, severe).
- Supports multiple image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).


## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Django==1.10
- TensorFlow==1.14.0
- Keras==2.2.4
- Atom
- Pillow==6.2.0
